# Bike Sharing Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this project is to visualize bike-sharing data from New York city to:
-	Show the amount of time bikes are checked out by all riders and by gender.
-	Show the total number of trips and the number of trips by gender for each day of the week.
-	Show the number of trips by user type and by gender for each day of the week.

## Results
Using Tableau, we created the following visuals:

### Customer Information

In this visual, we are able to see Citi Bike's 2,344,224 rides broken down into Customer and Subscriber groups and by gender. 

### Checkout Times for Users

This visual illustrates the amount of time bikes are checked out for. We can see that the majority of bikes are checked out for around 5 minutes.

### Checkout Times by Gender
![CheckoutGenders](/Resources/Checkout_gender.PNG)

This visual illustrates the amount of time bikes are checked out for by gender. Like the previous visual, the majority of bikes are checked out for around 5 minutes for each gender. We can also see that males use the bike-sharing service more often.

### Trips by Gender (Weekday per Hour)

This visual shows when each gender uses the bike-sharing service during weekdays. We can see that peak times are between 5 PM - 7PM for all genders and that males use the service more frequently. 

### Trips by Weekday per Hour

This visual shows when all riders use the bike-sharing service during weekdays. We can see that peak times are between 5 PM - 7PM.

### User Trips by Gender by Weekday
![Usertrips](/Resources/Weekday_usertype.PNG)

This visual shows when each user type uses the bike-sharing service and breaks it down by gender. Here we can see that male subscribes use the service more frequently, especially on Thursdays.

## Summary
Overall, we can tell that Citi Bike does a great job at attracting male customers and having them subscribe to their service. We also know that the busiest hours are between 5PM and 7PM. I would suggest visualizing the trip locations by gender, as well as the average trip duration by age and gender. This will give more insight into who is using the bike-sharing service in NYC.
